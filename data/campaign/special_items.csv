Even better its autofactories still used LCPs that are compatible with any modern carrier's. Unlike the combat drones however, it seems that Safeguard used non-corrupted probes to enhance its awareness of its surroundings. If integrated, those probe LCPs would significantly improve the fleet's capacity to survey planets from a distance.

Reproducing them would be difficult, but fortunately those devices are not directly laced with the nano-plague. Despite the battle damage, enough could be recovered to potentially improve the neutrino detection capacity of the fleet. If integrated to the ships of course.

They hope were somewhat doused when they found out the Plague-Bearer used a /"brute force/" approach with oversized engines and power-plants. However the drive field emmiters were not, and studying them revealed their surprisingly effective capacitors. Those seemingly inert solid blocks of metal are seemingly able to handle ridiculous amount of energy both charging and discharging without barely any heating. Integrating them into a ship could have the potential to make it immune to the damage caused by hyper-space storm strike and still use the excess energy to supercharge the drive fields.

A ship of this displacement indeed required very unusual drive field emitters to keep the bubble away from the hull. Their weird and somewhat echerian geodesic lens patterns have the as-yet unexplained effect of increasing the volume of a drive field with seemingly no increase in power draw compared to standard ones. While nobody is looking forward draining those complex and eminently fragile components from the inactive nano-machines, integrating them to your ships would improve their navigation performance when fully powered up for sustained burns.
