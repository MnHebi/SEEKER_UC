Captain's Log, 207.231

The Lookout is now back at full power! Man, what a sight! It's so sleek and fast, I love this ship! Only problem now is that we're broke... Well, actually "I" am broke, the crew is restless, and there are no easy jobs in sight (or at least not one that would allow us to break even).

The only offer with decent pay is from some local government, which want to know what the local Scavenger Union is up to in the nearby "Old Gate Graveyard". The trouble is that the rumors say they have found something big there, and plan to deliver it to the Bang-wa-goons (some dumb overgrown pirate group).
The entire mission smells fishy. We may find nothing but a bunch of freighters recycling nano-tubes from the hulks, or we could end up face to face with a full fledged pirate armada! The sole fact that the government didn't want to even dip a toe into these muddy waters spell "troubles" to my ear...

Aw heck, it's not like we have much of a choice anyway. I'll try to get at least a 25% deposit, while leaving the support ships here as a gesture of good faith; that should calm the crew.
