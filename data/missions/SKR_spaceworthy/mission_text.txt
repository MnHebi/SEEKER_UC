Captain's Log, 207.197

We are finally flying! Took us nearly three months to bring enough systems online and escape that hell-hole of a moon, but I can tell it will be worth it! Of course half the crew disagree, they think the ship will break apart when we will try to reach hyperspace. I know they are wrong: the hull may have been chewed away by the acid rains but the super-structure is intact. Heck, I didn't spent 30 days in a freaking NBC suit inspecting that hulk top from bottom before committing to salvage it for nothing! I don't know where this "DCS Lookout" comes from but she's a beauty! How comes someone abandoned her to rot? Okay the reactor was dry but still... Anyway, I can't wait to bring her to a dry-dock and restore her to her former glory.

Bloody hell, we just had finished packing up and were ready to leave that damn system when a band of second grade pirates jumped in. That system is empty, there is no reason for them to come here, someone must have tipped them off! I bet it's on of those miners bastards, they didn't liked it when I refused to pay their rates and just rented the material to work with my crew. I'm NOT giving up on the Lookout, not when we can finally fly away. We will try to loose them in the asteroid ring, should they hesitate to follow us or take too much damage in there and we will use that to our advantage and retaliate. We'll see what they got...
