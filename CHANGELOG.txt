   . Now has a custom musical theme, composed by Mesotronik, and made possible by the donations from all my generous patrons.

   . OP amount raised to 70 from 60.
   > The Hyperion got such a huge jump in power in 0.95! 

 - Hedone-class: 
   . Time Splitter system default time acceleration reduced to x10 from x16,
   . Time Splitter time acceleration raised to x15 with the System Expertise skill,
   . OP available raised to 50 from 45.
   > The Hedone should still be amazing while it lasts, but also a smidgen more versatile now

 - Marksman-class:
   . Perfect reloads now triples the damage of the next shot instead of doubling it.
   . Reload system tweaked to behave better with high level officers.
   . Reload system gets much easier to use with the System Expertise skill.
   . Hull and armor raised to 7000/750 from 5000/500.
   > The ship was a bit underwhelming for its fragility so this should fix that.

 - 557-class:
   . Flux dissipation increased to 600 from 400.
   . Redline ship-system no longer generates flux on activation.
   > While somewhat fun, it was difficult to let the main gun rip given how flux starved the ship was 

 - Bullhorn-class: Booster system now gains charges from the System Expertise skill instead of the Expanded Ammo Racks hullmod.

 - Tumbleweed-class:
   . Medium turret is now UNIVERSAL from HYBRID (to avoid some possible weapon type issues when restoring the pirate variant into a regular Tumbleweed)
   . Drone system now now has 2 charges from 8,
   . Now gets one additional drone every 20s.
   > Mostly cleanup for odd behaviors.

 - Balisong-class:
   . System charging no longer affects the engines performances (it still dramatically lowers the firepower)
   . System charging is now significantly faster with the System Expertise skill.
   . Shield is now a bubble front shield at 0.7 efficiency, from a omni 180deg shield at 0.8 efficiency.

 - Clipper-class: Missile Fab system now generates ammo faster with the System Expertise skill.

 - Quicksilver-class:
   . A few mounts are now UNIVERSAL from ENERGY and SYNERGY.
   . Denial Pulse system range lowered to 1200 from 2000, but respects the x2 System Expertise skill bonus.

   . two flight decks plus a Burn Drive system on toggle or the Flux Torpedoes system, 
   . two built-in Firecane turrets or a broadsider configuration with four additional large slots plus HBI.
   > The system is currently a bit jank and is most likely to be replaced by a proper paid-for dry-dock reconfiguration at some point. But given that it is now a unique ship, this will have to do for the moment.

 - Titanic-class: Now has Advanced Ground Support.

 - Erasmus-class wing:
   . Rocket pod ammo reduced to 10 from 15,
   . Fire-rate increased to 240 rpm from 45,

   > This wing should now properly operate like bombers.

 - Gatling Lance weapon:
   . Flux requirement lowered to 480 from 600.
   . Now causes Strong Interferences instead of Mild.
   > Using two of them will cause a 160 flux dissipation reduction from interferences, meaning you are still 80 dissipation ahead from before when firing. A more interesting proposition imo...
